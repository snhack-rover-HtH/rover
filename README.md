# snhack-rover ü§ñ
snhack-rover is the solution to many problems that hackers face during a hackathon which are wasting time, and energy while getting their snacks and waiting in line as well as getting distracted.

## Goal üéØ:
Help hackathon participants in maximizing their experience and time. This means reducing wait times for snacks, minimizing distractions, and preserving valuable coding time. Additionally, we aim to support individuals with disabilities, such as mobility impairments, social anxiety, dietary restrictions, claustrophobia, directional challenges, and others, who are often overlooked during these events.

## What it does üåü:
Our project introduces an autonomous robot that delivers snacks directly to participants, eliminating the need for them to leave their workstations. The robot is controlled through a web app where participants can log in, view available snack options, and place orders.

## Used Techonologies: 
| Front-end | Back-end | Deployment | Hardware |
| ---------| --------| --- | --- |
| Remix, React | Supabase | Vercel |  [Driver.js](https://driverjs.com/), WebGL for CAD file rendering

**Note**: make sure to have react, and npm installed first.

## How to access the control page of the robot ‚ùì
It is on the page " **rover** ".
To find it, you have two options: </br>
Firstly you have to run the app, and after that you can **place an order**, and you will be directed to the *control page* of the robot.
